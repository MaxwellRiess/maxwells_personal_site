        <h1>On digital service design in the public sector</h1>
        <div class="article-meta">June 1, 2024</div>
        <p>Exploring the unique challenges and opportunities of designing user-centric digital services within government frameworks. This involves navigating complex regulations, diverse user needs, and the immense scale of public impact. Unlike the private sector, the goal is not profit, but public value, accessibility, and trust.</p>
        <h2>The Core Principles</h2>
        <p>Effective public service design is built on a foundation of empathy and inclusivity. It means designing for everyone, regardless of their technical literacy, physical ability, or socioeconomic status. We must prioritize clarity over cleverness and reliability over novelty.</p>
        <h2>A Case Study in Practice</h2>
        <p>During my time on the Healthcare.gov project, we encountered a significant challenge with user verification. The initial process was confusing and led to high drop-off rates. Through iterative user research—speaking directly with citizens—we identified the key pain points and redesigned the workflow to be simpler and more transparent. The result was a measurable increase in successful enrollments and a decrease in user frustration.</p>
