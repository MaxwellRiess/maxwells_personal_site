        <h1>On building tools for thinking</h1>
        <div class="article-meta">May 15, 2024</div>
        <p>A deep dive into the philosophy and practice of creating computational tools that augment human intellect and creativity. These are not just tools for executing tasks, but for exploring ideas, revealing patterns, and extending our cognitive abilities. The goal is to create instruments that enable new kinds of thought.</p>
        <h2>From Passive Consumption to Active Creation</h2>
        <p>Many of our digital tools are designed for consumption. A tool for thinking, in contrast, should be a partner in the creative process. It should provide a canvas for exploration and a structure for building complex ideas from simple components, much like a programming language or a set of modular toys.</p>
        <h2>The Boids Example</h2>
        <p>The flocking simulation on this very website is a small example. It's a "tool for thinking" about complex systems. By playing with the parameters, you are not just observing, but actively exploring the rules that govern emergent behavior. This hands-on interaction builds a deeper, more intuitive understanding than simply reading a description.</p>
