        <h1>On lessons from the potter's wheel</h1>
        <div class="article-meta">April 28, 2024</div>
        <p>Reflections on how the ancient craft of pottery can inform modern product development, from embracing imperfections to finding balance. The potter's wheel is a powerful teacher of patience, iteration, and the subtle dance between intention and material reality.</p>
        <h2>Embracing the Wobble</h2>
        <p>No pot is perfectly symmetrical. The slight variations and imperfections are what give a handmade piece its character. In product development, we often strive for a flawless ideal, but sometimes the most beloved features are the ones that arise from unexpected constraints or "happy accidents." Learning to embrace the wobble is learning to see opportunity in imperfection.</p>
        <h2>The Importance of Centering</h2>
        <p>Before you can build the walls of a pot, the clay must be perfectly centered on the wheel. If it's off by even a millimeter, the entire structure will be unstable. The same is true for product strategy. Without a clear, centered vision—a core problem you are solving for a specific user—all subsequent efforts to build and scale will be wobbly and prone to collapse.</p>
